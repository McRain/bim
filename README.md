BimViewer: Your Tool for Working with IFC Models

BimViewer is a powerful and intuitive application designed specifically for BIM users and design engineers. It allows you to easily view IFC files in 3D, explore their internal structure, and interact with model elements.

Getting Started: Importing IFC

After importing an IFC file, which you can do through a convenient panel listing all your imported models, you'll see your model in 3D space. If this is your first import, the model will automatically appear in the scene.

Flexibility with Model Instances

BimViewer gives you unprecedented flexibility. You can add as many instances of a previously imported IFC file as you need. This allows you to create complex scenes or compare different configurations.

Interacting with the Model Hierarchy

After adding an instance to 3D space, activate the Hierarchy panel for complete control over the model:

View Child Elements: Explore groups and their subelements in detail.

Hide/Show Elements: Control the visibility of individual elements or entire groups for better analysis and focus.

Camera Focus: Instantly move the camera to selected elements or groups for a closer look.

To start working with a clean scene, simply use the "Clear" button at the bottom of the interface.
